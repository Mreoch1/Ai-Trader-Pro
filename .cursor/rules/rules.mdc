AI Trader Pro - Project Rules (Cursor AI)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Structure & File Management
	‚Ä¢	Keep files under 500 lines whenever possible for better readability and maintainability.

	‚Ä¢	infrastructure/ ‚Üí Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)
	‚Ä¢	scripts/ ‚Üí Automation scripts
	‚Ä¢	docs/ ‚Üí Documentation
	‚Ä¢	tests/ ‚Üí Unit and integration tests

2Ô∏è‚É£ Development Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Use TypeScript for frontend (React + Vite).
	‚Ä¢	Follow RESTful API best practices in backend.
	‚Ä¢	Write clean, well-documented code.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure AI-generated code follows project rules before committing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX Standards
